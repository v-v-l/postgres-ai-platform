# Contributing to PostgreSQL AI/ML Docker Setup

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project aims to provide a comprehensive, production-ready PostgreSQL setup with advanced AI/ML capabilities.

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
- Use GitHub Issues with the `bug` label
- Include your OS, Docker version, and steps to reproduce
- Provide logs from `docker-compose logs`

### Suggesting Features
- Use GitHub Issues with the `enhancement` label  
- Explain the use case and expected behavior
- Consider if it fits the project's AI/ML focus

### Contributing Code
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Test with both dev and prod configurations
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Submit a Pull Request

## üß™ Testing Your Changes

### Required Tests
```bash
# Test development setup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
psql "postgresql://postgres:CHANGE_ME_TO_STRONG_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/postgres" -c "SELECT extname FROM pg_extension;"

# Test production setup  
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
psql "postgresql://postgres:CHANGE_ME_TO_STRONG_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/postgres" -c "SELECT * FROM hybrid_search('test', ARRAY(SELECT random() FROM generate_series(1, 1536))::vector, 0.5, 0.5, 1);"

# Clean up
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down -v
```

### Extension Testing
If adding new PostgreSQL extensions:
- Ensure they work in the pgvector Docker image
- Add proper error handling in SQL scripts
- Update the README with usage examples
- Test with both ARM64 and x86_64 architectures

## üìã Code Standards

### SQL Scripts
- Use `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS`
- Include proper error handling for optional extensions
- Add comments explaining AI/ML use cases
- Follow PostgreSQL naming conventions

### Docker Configuration
- Maintain compatibility with both dev and prod modes
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Include health checks for new services
- Document any new environment variables

### Documentation
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Include real-world examples for new features
- Explain the AI/ML benefits and use cases
- Keep examples practical and business-focused

## üéØ Project Goals

This project focuses on:
- **AI/ML capabilities** - Vector search, embeddings, hybrid search
- **Production readiness** - Security, performance, monitoring
- **Developer experience** - Easy setup, clear documentation
